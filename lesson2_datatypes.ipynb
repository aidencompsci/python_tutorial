    "Programming at it's most fundamental level is about managing increasingly abstract levels of data. A programming language like Python lets you deal with things like `objects and things`, `words and text`, and `numbers`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common example of a 'Lower Level Language' is `Assembly`. This language doesn't deal so much with `types` of data, but rather deals with locations of data on the physical computer itself. Assembly itself is another abstraction on top of the `1's and 0's` of binary that computers read. The 1's and 0's are even *another* abstraction on top of physical elements inside the computer like `silicon` and `copper` and billions of billions of electrons wizzing around cables."
